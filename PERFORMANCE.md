# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations made to improve the website's loading and scrolling performance.

## Key Improvements

1. **Hardware Acceleration**
   - Used `transform: translateZ(0)` and `translate3d()` to enable GPU acceleration
   - Added `will-change` property to elements that animate frequently
   - Applied hardware acceleration to timeline animations in Experience component

2. **Animation Optimization**
   - Reduced animation complexity and frequency
   - Lengthened animation durations for heavy animations (30-45s instead of 10-20s)
   - Reduced blur intensity (`blur-xl` instead of `blur-3xl`) for background elements
   - Simplified and reduced the number of animated background elements
   - Reduced timeline pulse animations from three to two per node

3. **Image Loading**
   - Implemented `OptimizedImage` component with lazy loading
   - Added proper image placeholder handling
   - Added preload hints for critical resources

4. **Scroll Performance**
   - Used `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother animation scheduling
   - Implemented optimized intersection observer patterns
   - Reduced staggered animation delay times
   - Fixed Experience timeline rendering on first scroll with multiple observer strategies

5. **Resource Management**
   - Added proper cleanup for async operations with AbortController
   - Reduced number of reflows and repaints
   - Added preconnect hints for external resources

6. **First Load Experience**
   - Added preload for content.json to ensure data is available immediately
   - Restructured Experience component to initialize animations as soon as possible
   - Added dual observer system for Experience component (one for section, one for timeline items)
   - Reduced Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) with minimum heights

## Implementation Notes

- The PortfolioOptimized component uses modern React patterns like `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- CSS animations are optimized with hardware-accelerated properties
- Background blur effects are reduced or eliminated for better scrolling performance
- Experience timeline now uses separate effects for data fetching and animation setup

## Future Optimizations

- Consider implementing image size optimization or a CDN solution for images
- Bundle splitting to reduce initial load time
- Further component code splitting for larger sections
- Implement progressive loading of animations to further reduce initial load time
